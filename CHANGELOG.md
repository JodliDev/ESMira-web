### üöÄ Added

- Bookmarks System: All subpages in the ESMira admin interface now have a star icon in their top right corner. When clicked this creates a bookmark, which will be displayed in a list on the main admin page. This can be helpful if you have, e.g., a long list of studies but often need to edit one study that is currently active.
- Option "Always keep questionnaire accessible" added to questionnaires. This is checked by default. Disabling this option will prevent ESMira from listing the questionnaire under the inactive questionnaires menu in the client.
- Option "Allow Other" for single choice and multiple choice items. When checked, ESMira will automatically add the option "other" to the list of available options for that item. When selected, ESMira will display a text field for participants to enter an appropriate option (this will be stored in a separate column in the data file).
- Duration input item. This item consists of two numeric input fields for hours and minutes.
- Docker Configuration: ESMira is now set up to be used with Docker.
