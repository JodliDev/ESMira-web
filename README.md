# Heads up!
## ESMira on Android and iOS is about to change!
**We are redesigning the UI of the Android and iOS app. The functionality will stay the same but especially the start screen will be quite different.
We are planning on rolling out the new update at the beginning of May. if you are planning to conduct a new study soon, it might be less confusing for your participants if your start the study after the rollout**

An example of the new starting screen:
